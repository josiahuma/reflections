1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- .git file is created in repo
- no commit is made
- all files in repo are listed untracked

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different because it serves as a holding ground for files from the WD before they get committed to the repo.
The staging area offers a very important value as it make the user commit only what it wants to.
